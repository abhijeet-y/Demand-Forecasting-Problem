-**VARMAX NB-Forecasting for all.ipynb** ; [Timeseries Analysis->Predictions->VARMAX]
This notebook can be used to run and VARMAX model for all the ongoing items and then save the results to CSV.

-**VARMAX NB-Forecasting for Individual.ipynb** ; [Timeseries Analysis->Predictions->VARMAX]
This notebook can be used to run and VARMAX model for single individual ongoing item.

-**ARIMA, SARIMA- Hyperparameter Search.ipynb** ; [Timeseries Analysis->Predictions->ARIMA_SARIMA]
This notebook can be used to run and fit ARIMA, SARIMA models on the original as well as capped data, this notebook contains code for hyperparameter search for the model ARIMA, SARIMA.

-**ARIMA, SARIMA-Forecasting for individual.ipynb** ; [Timeseries Analysis->Predictions->ARIMA_SARIMA]
This notebook can be used to run and fit ARIMA, SARIMA models on the original as well as capped data, In this notebook we can specify already learned model parameters stored in orders.csv.

-**Categorising Timeseries.ipynb** ; [Timeseries Analysis->EDA->Classified TimeSeries]
In this notebook on the basis of EDA, classification of timeseris is done into Ongoing, Discontinued and Newly Launched.

-**ErrorMetrics.xls** ; [Timeseries Analysis->Predictions->Errors_CSV]
This workbook contains the results and errors generated after fitting the model on test data.
